# **App Name**: Adherence Insights Explorer

## Core Features:

- Data Import and Validation: Securely import data from CSV, or other common data formats, with real-time validation to ensure data integrity within the browser session.
- Interactive Time Series Visualization: Visualize adherence data as an interactive time series, allowing users to zoom, pan, and highlight specific periods of interest. Generative AI recommends relevant analyses (using a tool) to automatically detect statistically significant trends within user selected window.
- Correlation Analysis: Calculate and visualize correlations between adherence patterns and other data variables (e.g., time of day, day of week, other clinical measures) using various statistical methods (correlation matrix, scatter plots).
- Cohort Analysis: Allows segmenting patient population to compare adherence pattern in the specific group of interest to identify trends related to the sub-population.
- Data Anonymization Assurance: Include a built-in mechanism that gives report for degree of anonymization within provided dataset using various matrix such as k-anonymity and l-diversity. Users will be given an opportunity to resolve identified issues for total anonymity.
- Session Data Erasure: Ensure all imported data and analysis results are completely erased from the browser's memory when the session ends, guaranteeing no sensitive information is stored.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to convey authority and a sense of scientific rigor.
